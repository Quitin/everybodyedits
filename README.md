### What happened to Everybody Edits
Everybody Edits was a Flash game, so it was not a very stable game. It was vulnerable to the Flash shutdown of January 2021.

Everybody Edits was created in 2010 March 13 and shut down in 2020 December 31. The game lasted for a mere 10 years.

Everybody Edits was shut down because of Adobe Flash Player's End Of Life, which caused many Flash games to cease to exist online.
